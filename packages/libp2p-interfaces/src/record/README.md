interface-record
==================

A libp2p node needs to store data in a public location (e.g. a DHT), or rely on potentially untrustworthy intermediaries to relay information. Libp2p provides an all-purpose data container called **envelope**, which includes a signature of the data, so that it its authenticity can be verified.

The record represents the data that will be stored inside the **envelope** when distributing records across the network. The `interface-record` aims to guarantee that any type of record created is compliant with the libp2p **envelope**.

Taking into account that a record might be used in different contexts, an **envelope** signature made for a specific purpose **must not** be considered valid for a different purpose. Accordingly, each record has a short and descriptive string representing the record use case, known as **domain**. The data to be signed will be prepended with the domain string, in order to create a domain signature.

A record can also contain a Uint8Array codec (ideally registered as a [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec)). This codec will prefix the record data in the **envelope** , so that it can be deserialized deterministically.

## Usage

```js
const tests = require('libp2p-interfaces-compliance-tests/record')
describe('your record', () => {
  tests({
    async setup () {
      return YourRecord
    },
    async teardown () {
      // cleanup resources created by setup()
    }
  })
})
```

## Create Record

```js
const multicodec = require('multicodec')
const Record = require('libp2p-interfaces/src/record')
const { fromString } = require('uint8arrays/from-string')
// const Protobuf = require('./record.proto')

const ENVELOPE_DOMAIN_PEER_RECORD = 'libp2p-peer-record'
const ENVELOPE_PAYLOAD_TYPE_PEER_RECORD = fromString('0301', 'hex')

/**
 * @implements {import('libp2p-interfaces/src/record/types').Record}
 */
class PeerRecord {
  constructor (peerId, multiaddrs, seqNumber) {
    this.domain = ENVELOPE_DOMAIN_PEER_RECORD
    this.codec = ENVELOPE_PAYLOAD_TYPE_PEER_RECORD
  }

  /**
   * Marshal a record to be used in an envelope.
   *
   * @returns {Uint8Array}
   */
  marshal () {
    // Implement and return using Protobuf
  }

  /**
   * Returns true if `this` record equals the `other`.
   *
   * @param {PeerRecord} other
   * @returns {other is Record}
   */
  equals (other) {
    // Verify
  }
}
```

## API

### marshal

- `record.marshal()`

Marshal a record to be used in a libp2p envelope.

**Returns**

It returns a `Protobuf` containing the record data.

### equals

- `record.equals(other)`

Verifies if the other Record is identical to this one.

**Parameters**
- other is a `Record` to compare with the current instance.

**Returns**
- `other is Record`
