## Description

 We can't use PeerIds as collection keys because collection keys are compared using same-value-zero equality, so this is just a group of collections that stringifies PeerIds before storing them.

 PeerIds cache stringified versions of themselves so this should be a cheap operation.

## Example

```JavaScript
import { peerMap, peerSet, peerList } from '@libp2p/peer-collections'

const map = peerMap<string>()
map.set(peerId, 'value')

const set = peerSet()
set.add(peerId)

const list = peerList()
list.push(peerId)
```

## Installation

```console
$ npm i @libp2p/peer-collections
```
