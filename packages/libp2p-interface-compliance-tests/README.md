## Usage

Each [interface](../interfaces) has its documentation on how to use the compliance tests and should be used as the source of truth.

## Contribute

The libp2p implementation in JavaScript is a work in progress. As such, there are a few things you can do right now to help out:

 - Go through the modules and **check out existing issues**. This would be especially useful for modules in active development. Some knowledge of IPFS/libp2p may be required, as well as the infrastructure behind it - for instance, you may need to read up on p2p and more complex operations like muxing to be able to help technically.
 - **Perform code reviews**. More eyes will help a) speed the project along b) ensure quality and c) reduce possible future bugs.
 - **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests.
